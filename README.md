# What is this?
BMI-calc-online is the result of me being bored during the 2 week holiday i am having.
At college, we've been recomended to code, so that we can remember what we've learned.
We've only been learning CSS and html thus far, but i want to go the extra mile and make the pages less booring, and make a BMI calculator that can run in the browser my self, with JS.
#### More content will be added to this repository and the readme will be updated as i go along.
